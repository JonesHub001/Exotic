<div class="temperament">

    <h1>Temperament</h1>
    <p><img src="AmericanBullyForFamilies.jpg" alt="American Bully playing with kids">American Pitbull Terriers/American Bully descended from extremely
        people-oriented breeds. These dogs are very affectionate, even clingy. Despite their forbidding exterior,
        <em>American bully /pitbull</em> are soft-hearted, enjoy affection and interacting with humans. These dogs love
        the entire family rather than just one person and are known to adore children.</p>
    <p>American Bullies / Pit bulls have a high tolerance of pain and are able to withstand roughness and even pain
        inflicted by children. They rarely snarl and never bite. At the same time, they know that children are their
        tireless playmates and best friends. As is the case with other breeds, correct socialization is key for normal
        interaction between these dogs and children.</p>
    <p>Bullies and Pitbulls strangers well, as aggressiveness was a highly undesirable trait for their ancestors. If
        raised correctly, they are friendly and well-mannered. Some individual dogs may be wary and distrustful, but
        friendly animals who regard strangers as potential friends constitute the vast majority of the breed. However,
        they still need to undergo training, as these dogs’ physical strength makes them unmanageable in a hostile
        situation.</p>
    <p>American Pit-bull Terriers / American Bully have natural protective instinct but are calm. They may make
        acceptable watch dogs, but are not sufficiently aggressive for this purpose. However, they don’t really need to
        be aggressive, as their looks are often deterring enough.</p>
